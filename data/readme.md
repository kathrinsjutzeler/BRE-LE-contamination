**BRE_LE_pheno.xlsx:** This file contains data needed to generate Figure 1. It lists cercarial shedding and worm burden over the years.

**LE_specific.filter.zip:** This file contains SmLE specific variant information for Figure 4. These variants were absent in all BRE pools until the contamination event occured. 

**conta_metadata.csv:** This file lists the metadata to calculate the selection coefficient in Figure 4.

**LE_high_Fst.table:** This file is used for Figure 5A. It contains FST values for 246 variants that are present in all pools sampled. 

**LE_var_tables.zip:** These files are needed for Figure 5B. It contains variants for male and female pools which will be overlapped with FST data.  

Note, F<sub>ST</sub> files are too big to share here, but can be calculated as described in the methods section of the manuscript, or obtained by contacting me.
